Placeholder.   This isn't ready for prime time yet.   Mostly, just type
./configure and then make, and then play with it.   On Linux, you can
run the client with the system configured, because on Linux more than one
client is allowed to listen for DHCP messages.   The client doesn't yet
work on an unconfigured interface; this will require some small kernel
hacks, I think.
