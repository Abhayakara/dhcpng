Some ranting about DHCP client architecture.

What we mean by client could be a number of things.   I can think of a
few components:

[PERC]   the thing that keeps track of the persistent configuration
[EPHC]   the thing that keeps track of the ephemeral configuration
[PROT]   the protocol engine itself
[UPDATE] the thing that applies the current configuration state to the
	 system
[FETCH]	 the thing that extracts the current system state and updates
	 the ephemeral configuration from it.
[PCTRL]	 the thing that manages the protocol engine
[QUERY]	 the thing you use to query the client's state

[UPDATE] isn't really a DHCP client function.   It's a system function
that the DHCP client uses.

Let's see how this whole thing operates.   Imagine the initial system
startup sequence:

  The system comes up.   There may be some network state, for example
    if it did a network boot.
  [PROT] starts; does nothing.
  [UPDATE] starts; does nothing.
  [PERC] starts; does nothing.
  [EPHC] starts in state where chances to configuration are not reflecte
  [EPHC] updates its internal configuration from [PERC].
  [EPHC] updates its internal configuration from [FETCH]
	(this avoids trashing autoconfiguration the kernel may have done)
  [EPHC] enters the state where changes to configuration are reflected
  [PCTRL] is invoked by the system startup scripts to configure eth0
  [PCTRL] tells [PROT] to start on eth0
  [PROT] consults [EPHC] to get current status of eth0
  [PROT] begins the protocol as appropriate according to that status
  [PROT] pushes results of protocol to [EPHC]
  [EPHC] reflects changes to [UPDATE]
  [EPHC] reflects changes to [PERC]
  [EPHC] announces that network configuration for eth0 has changed.

  Notice that aside from the system itself, EPHC is the central
  repository for the current configuration of an adapter.

  Now the user wants to make a configuration change.   The user uses
  an external program to make this change.   We'll call that program
  [MANAGE] and the user [USER]:

  [MANAGE] gets list of adapters (how?)
  [MANAGE] gets configuration of each adapter from [EPHC]
  [MANAGE] presents a list of adapters with their abbreviated
	   configuration to [USER]
  [USER] selects eth0
  [MANAGE] presents detailed eth0 configuration
  [USER] directs [MANAGE] to release the lease for eth0.
  [MANAGE] tells [PCTRL] to release the lease for eth0.
  [PCTRL] tells [PROT] to release the lease for eth0.
  [PROT] tells [EPHC] that it is releasing the lease for eth0
  [EPHC] tells [PERC] that eth0 no longer has a lease.
  [PERC] acknowledges to [EPHC] that it has recorded the change.
  [EPHC] acknowledges to [PROT] that it has recorded the change.
  [PROT] sends a DHCPRELEASE (assuming V4).
  [PROT] tells [EPHC] that we have no IP address for eth0
  [EPHC] tells [UPDATE] to release the IP address on eth0.
  [EPHC] announces that the configuration for eth0 has changed.
  [MANAGE] fetches configuration for eth0 from [EPHC]
  [MANAGE] presents configuration.
  [USER] tells [MANAGE] to get a lease for eth0.
  [MANAGE] tells [PCTRL] to get a lease for eth0.
  [PCTRL] tells [PROT] to get a lease for eth0.
  [PROT] begins protocol
  [PROT] pushes results of protocol to [EPHC]
  [EPHC] reflects change to [UPDATE]
  [EPHC] reflects change to [PERC]
  [EPHC] announces that the configuration for eth0 has changed.
  [MANAGE] fetches configuration for eth0 from [EPHC]
  [MANAGE] presents configuration for eth0.

  Let's say the user wants a manual address, so they go into [MANAGE]

  [MANAGE] gets list of adapters (how?)
  [MANAGE] gets configuration of each adapter from [EPHC]
  [MANAGE] presents a list of adapters with their abbreviated
	   configuration to [USER]
  [USER] selects eth0
  [MANAGE] presents detailed eth0 configuration
  [USER] selects manual configuration
  [MANAGE] presents UI for setting up IP address, etc.
  [USER] sets it up
  [USER] says "go."
  [MANAGE] sends static configuration to [EPHC]
  [EPHC] sends static config to [PERC]
  [EPHC] tells DHCP client to stop
  [EPHC] reflects new configuration to [UPDATE]
  [EPHC] announces that configuration for eth0 has changed.
  [MANAGE] fetches configuration for eth0 from [EPHC]
  [MANAGE] presents configuration for eth0.
